# First-Project-on-UNO-board
- Project for Ardruino UNO R3 board with the ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04. Embedded code processes pinging the distance and applying Kalman filter for smoothing. 
As a result, output raw and filtered distance, along with the reflected object velocity are monitored in real time via Ardruino IDE.

- Sample of the collected data on the serial output and the Python script for post processesing is provided as well. 
This script serves to demonstrate the practical benefit of Kalman filter (smoother tracking), as well as residual analysis.
